# Premade Regions

Provides region information in the premade groups and applicants listings as well as to other addons.

When used as a standalone addon it will show the region of the group leader or applicant.  When used in combination with premade groups you can also filter groups by the group leaders region.

Example

To look for mythic plus groups who fit your party makeup and are not from US East or Mexico servers you would use the following advanced expression query.

mythicplus and partyfit and not (use or mex)
